# 🏎️ Formula 1 Performance Analysis (2015 - 2024)
This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of Formula 1 team and driver performance between 2015 and 2024. By leveraging Python, data visualization, and interactive web tools, we aim to explore how the competitive landscape of Formula 1 has evolved, focusing particularly on the rivalry between Mercedes, Red Bull, Lewis Hamilton, and Max Verstappen.


📌 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to:

✅ Compare the dominance periods of Mercedes and Red Bull in Formula 1
✅ Analyze the evolution of team and driver performance over a 10-year period
✅ Explore whether Max Verstappen's 2023 season represents the most dominant performance in F1 history
✅ Compare the first 5 seasons of Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen to assess who had the stronger career start

Through these analyses, we aim to validate or refute the proposed hypotheses.
🎯 Project Hypotheses
🔵 Main Hypothesis
The Mercedes team achieved superior results (points and Constructors' Championships) compared to Red Bull between 2015 and 2021. Starting from 2021, Red Bull has dominated Formula 1 based on the same performance metrics.

🟡 Secondary Hypotheses
Max Verstappen had the most dominant season ever by an F1 driver during the 2023 season, measured by points and race victories.

Lewis Hamilton had a more successful start to his career (first 5 seasons) than Max Verstappen, based on points scored and races won.
